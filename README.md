- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jen Beaudry. After 15 years in academia, I'm now a professional staff member at a university. 
I don't want to lose my hard-earned (but still relatively novice) R programming skills so I am continuing to 
use R to analyse evaluations and complete reports on different projects and programs. I am also a passionate
advocate about open science.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in open science and R programming. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to write efficient functions and parameterized reports.
